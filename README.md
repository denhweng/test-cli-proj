# IMDB CLI

Welcome to the IMDB CLI Gem! This gem allows users to see the 5 top-grossing movies playing in theatres right now. Choices by the user will show corresponding movies, and in-depth details like release date, audience, rating, runtime, and summary. Look no further than this gem, to find what blockbuster to watch next. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'test-cli-proj'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install test-cli-proj

## Usage

Run the IMDB CLI by typing "ruby bin/console" into the terminal. Follow the intructions in the terminal - choose a movie by its corresponding number to see more details about it. Keep choosing corresponding numbers, or if you're done, type "exit" into the terminal to quit the CLI.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
